The official NIH DMS Policy FAQ page can be found here: [`https://osp.od.nih.gov/scientific-sharing/nih-policy-for-data-management-and-sharing-faq/`](https://osp.od.nih.gov/scientific-sharing/nih-policy-for-data-management-and-sharing-faq/){target="_blank"}.


# Additional Resources {-}

Librarians and other stakeholders have joined minds to produce guidance materials for researchers, libraries, and librarians to prepare for the 2023 NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy. This working group has created documents for librarians and researchers to use in their institutions as they work to comply with the new policy, including: 

- Glossaries of DMSP & NIH Grant Terminology 

- Checklist for Researchers 

- Policy Readiness Checklist for Librarians 

- Example DMSP & Example DMSP catalog 

You can download the materials and see any updated releases at the [OSF project page](https://osf.io/uadxr/). They have also utilized the [OSF wiki](https://osf.io/uadxr/wiki/home/) to provide descriptions of their outputs, as well as citation information. 

Several other university libraries have also created guides on data management you may find useful, including [Northwestern](https://libguides.northwestern.edu/datamanagement), [Stanford](https://library.stanford.edu/research/data-management-services), [MIT](https://libraries.mit.edu/data-management/), [University of Pittsburgh](https://hsls.libguides.com/data), and [NYU](https://hslguides.med.nyu.edu/data_management).

Feel free to remix these documents to suit your needs with credit to the NIH DMSP Guidance Working Group.

In addition, there are several tools that can help you write your plan and make sure that it complies with all the policies that you need to comply with:

- [DMPTool](https://dmptool.org/) - a tool for:
  - writing your plan
  - associating your plan with your [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) ID
  - sharing your plan (if you wish)
  - finding other people's plans
  - finding guidelines for various sharing policies
- [SPARC](http://datasharing.sparcopen.org/data) - a resource for comparing different data sharing policies for a variety of funding agencies in the United States
  - includes many different funding agencies, such as the [USDA](https://www.usda.gov/), [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/), [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/), [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/), [DOE](https://www.energy.gov/) and more
  - note that the NIH data sharing information is currently for the 2003 policy (this will likely change after the new plan goes into effect in Jan 2023)
- [Sherpa Juliet](http://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/juliet/) - also a resource for different policies for a variety of funding agencies
  - includes information on requirements for **open access publication**, as well as information about data archiving
- [Council on Government Relations (COGR)](https://www.cogr.edu/chapter-2-nih-data-management-and-sharing-policy-matrix) - additional information about policy requirements
