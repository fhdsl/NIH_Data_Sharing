The main requirement of this new policy is that researchers include a Data Management and Sharing (DMS) plan with their proposal. Not all research will require data sharing. However, everyone must provide a justification if they can’t share their data. Once a DMS plan is accepted by the funding agency (updates can be made during the Just-in-Time process), the researchers will be required to carry out the plan. However, updates can be made to the plan as well. In this course we will describe what the new policy requires, places where you might want to share your particular kind of data, and how to deal with possible challenges associated with the policy. 0.1 Motivation We want to help make the process of compliance with this new policy easier. 0.2 Target Audience The course is intended for anyone who plans to submit a grant proposal to the NIH after January 25th, 2023. 0.3 Curriculum The course will cover: Motivations behind the new policy Overview of the new policy requirements and how it may affect you Suggestions about where to share your data Recommendations about how to budget for your data Guidance about how to write a DMS plan Information on how to submit the DMS plan to funding agencies Guidance on how to update a DMS plan after submission or funding General tips and frequently asked questions 0.4 Authors This course was developed by the Fred Hutch Data Science Lab. Please see the author credits for more information. "],["why-this-new-dms-policy.html", "Chapter 1 Why this new DMS policy?", " Chapter 1 Why this new DMS policy? First we will discuss the motivations behind the new data management and sharing policy that will go into effect for (most) grant proposals submitted to the NIH after January 25, 2023. So why is the NIH doing this? There are several reasons why sharing data can be beneficial to the scientific community. Supports transparency - Sharing data provides more clarity about how studies are performed. Encourages reproducibility and rigor - Having the data accessible, allows others to try to reproduce study findings. This can further enable studies that may replicate or validate the initial findings with different data. Supports multi-modal work - When more data of various types are easily available it makes it easier for scientist to perform studies with multiple types of data. More efficient and cost effective - Some data are especially difficult or expensive to produce. Supports Researcher Inclusion - Data generation can be especially difficult for those at institutes with less resources. Publicly available data can therefore be used by these researchers to better enable their participation. Increased impact - Papers that share their data in repositories appear to be cited more based on the study by Colavizza et al. (2020) Increased collaboration opportunity - Having data available can encourage other researchers to expand the research in a new direction or extend it further and they may reach out to collaborate. Data Citations - Due to the importance of data generation and sharing to the NIH, data will now be seen as research product that demonstrates a contribution to the scientific community.

You can refer to the NIH overview of which research will be covered by this new policy. The major requirement of the policy is that all grant proposals (submitted after January 25th, 2023) for mechanisms that require compliance, must include a plan for how they will manage and share their data. For certain grant mechanisms for projects that do not generate data, compliance with the policy is not required. For certain types of data, sharing is not possible, and a justification will be required instead. What about grant renewals? What about no cost extensions? What grant mechanisms don’t require compliance with the policy? What are examples of reasons why you might not share your data that would be acceptable? outline pieces When compliance is required (bit confused about training wards for T and F - I think they are saying don’t need to only when they don’t generate data, but they definitely often do) - what is scientific data and what it is not Major aspects: - need to submit Data Management and Sharing (DMS) plan with all applications after Jan 2023 - would need to actually share or not share your data based on what plan gets approved - importantly you do not need to necessarily share your data, but you need to submit a DMS with a justification about why you shouldn’t share your data Reasons why you might not share your data - legal/ethical/technical (I think being too large to be cost prohibitive is possible) examples - Unacceptable reasons why you might not share your data examples "],["data-managementstorage-options.html", "Chapter 3 Data Management/Storage Options 3.1 Data Storage Concerns 3.2 Data Sharing Repositories", " Chapter 3 Data Management/Storage Options 3.1 Data Storage Concerns How you should store and interact with data while doing research. 3.2 Data Sharing Repositories Once you need to share it as part of this policy, what do you do then?
