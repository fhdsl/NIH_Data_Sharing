The main requirement of this new policy is that researchers include a Data Management and Sharing (DMS) plan with their proposal. Not all research will require data sharing. However, everyone must provide a justification if they can’t share their data. Once a DMS plan is accepted by the funding agency (updates can be made during the Just-in-Time process), the researchers will be required to carry out the plan. However, updates can be made to the plan as well. In this course we will describe what the new policy requires, places where you might want to share your particular kind of data, and how to deal with possible challenges associated with the policy.

It’s simplest to use the ottrpal package: But if you have the slide or some other image locally downloaded you can also use HTML like this: 2.5 Video examples You may also want to embed videos in your course. If alternatively, you just want to include a link you can do so like this: Check out this link to a video using markdown syntax. 2.5.1 Using knitr To embed videos in your course, you can use knitr::include_url() like this: Note that you should use echo=FALSE in the code chunk because we don’t want the code part of this to show up. If you are unfamiliar with how R Markdown code chunks work, read this. 2.5.2 Using HTML 2.6 File examples You can again use simple markdown syntax to just include a link to a file like so: A file. Alternatively you can embed files like PDFs. 2.6.1 Using knitr 2.6.2 Using HTML 2.7 Website Examples Yet again you can use a link to a website like so: A Website Or, you can embed some websites. 2.7.1 Using knitr This works: 2.7.2 Using HTML 2.8 Citation examples We can put citations at the end of a sentence like this (Allaire et al. 2021). Or multiple citations Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund (2018). but they need a ; separator (Allaire et al. 2021; Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018). In text, we can put citations like this Allaire et al. (2021). 2.9 Stylized boxes Occasionally, you might find it useful to emphasize a particular piece of information. To help you do so, we have provided css code and images (no need for you to worry about that!) to create the following stylized boxes. You can use these boxes in your course with either of two options: using HTML code or Pandoc syntax. 2.9.1 Using rmarkdown container syntax The rmarkdown package allows for a different syntax to be converted to the HTML that you just saw and also allows for conversion to LaTeX. See the Bookdown documentation for more information (Xie, Dervieux, and Riederer 2020). Note that Bookdown uses Pandoc. ::: {.notice} Note using rmarkdown syntax. ::: Note using rmarkdown syntax. As an example you might do something like this: Please click on the subsection headers in the left hand navigation bar (e.g., 2.1, 4.3) a second time to expand the table of contents and enable the scroll_highlight feature (see more) 2.9.2 Using HTML To add a warning box like the following use: &lt;div class = &quot;notice&quot;&gt; Followed by the text you want inside &lt;/div&gt; This will create the following: Followed by the text you want inside Here is a &lt;div class = \"warning\"&gt; box: Note text Here is a &lt;div class = \"github\"&gt; box: GitHub text Here is a &lt;div class = \"dictionary\"&gt; box: dictionary text Here is a &lt;div class = \"reflection\"&gt; box: reflection text 2.10 Dropdown summaries You can hide additional information in a dropdown menu Here’s more words that are hidden. 2.11 Print out session info You should print out session info when you have code for reproducibility purposes. devtools::session_info() ## ─ Session info ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## setting value ## version R version 4.0.2 (2020-06-22) ## os Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS ## system x86_64, linux-gnu ## ui X11 ## language (EN) ## collate en_US.UTF-8 ## ctype en_US.UTF-8 ## tz Etc/UTC ## date 2022-10-19 ## ## ─ Packages ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## package * version date lib source ## assertthat 0.2.1 2019-03-21 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## bookdown 0.24 2022-02-15 [1] Github (rstudio/bookdown@88bc4ea) ## callr 3.4.4 2020-09-07 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.2) ## cli 2.0.2 2020-02-28 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.0) ## crayon 1.3.4 2017-09-16 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.0) ## curl 4.3 2019-12-02 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## desc 1.2.0 2018-05-01 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## devtools 2.3.2 2020-09-18 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## digest 0.6.25 2020-02-23 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.0) ## ellipsis 0.3.1 2020-05-15 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## evaluate 0.14 2019-05-28 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## fansi 0.4.1 2020-01-08 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.0) ## fs 1.5.0 2020-07-31 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## glue 1.6.1 2022-01-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.0.2) ## highr 0.8 2019-03-20 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## hms 0.5.3 2020-01-08 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.0) ## htmltools 0.5.0 2020-06-16 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.1) ## httr 1.4.2 2020-07-20 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## jquerylib 0.1.4 2021-04-26 [1] CRAN (R 4.0.2) ## knitr 1.33 2022-02-15 [1] Github (yihui/knitr@a1052d1) ## lifecycle 1.0.0 2021-02-15 [1] CRAN (R 4.0.2) ## magrittr 2.0.2 2022-01-26 [1] CRAN (R 4.0.2) ## memoise 1.1.0 2017-04-21 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.0) ## ottrpal 0.1.2 2022-02-15 [1] Github (jhudsl/ottrpal@1018848) ## pillar 1.4.6 2020-07-10 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.2) ## pkgbuild 1.1.0 2020-07-13 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.2) ## pkgconfig 2.0.3 2019-09-22 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## pkgload 1.1.0 2020-05-29 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## prettyunits 1.1.1 2020-01-24 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## processx 3.4.4 2020-09-03 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.2) ## ps 1.3.4 2020-08-11 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.2) ## purrr 0.3.4 2020-04-17 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## R6 2.4.1 2019-11-12 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.0) ## readr 1.4.0 2020-10-05 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.2) ## remotes 2.2.0 2020-07-21 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## rlang 0.4.10 2022-02-15 [1] Github (r-lib/rlang@f0c9be5) ## rmarkdown 2.10 2022-02-15 [1] Github (rstudio/rmarkdown@02d3c25) ## rprojroot 2.0.2 2020-11-15 [1] CRAN (R 4.0.2) ## sessioninfo 1.1.1 2018-11-05 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## stringi 1.5.3 2020-09-09 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## stringr 1.4.0 2019-02-10 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## testthat 3.0.1 2022-02-15 [1] Github (R-lib/testthat@e99155a) ## tibble 3.0.3 2020-07-10 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.2) ## usethis 2.1.5.9000 2022-02-15 [1] Github (r-lib/usethis@57b109a) ## vctrs 0.3.4 2020-08-29 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.2) ## withr 2.3.0 2020-09-22 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.2) ## xfun 0.26 2022-02-15 [1] Github (yihui/xfun@74c2a66) ## yaml 2.2.1 2020-02-01 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## ## [1] /usr/local/lib/R/site-library ## [2] /usr/local/lib/R/library References "],["about-the-authors.html", "About the Authors", " About the Authors These credits are based on our course contributors table guidelines.     Credits Names Pedagogy Lead Content Instructor(s) FirstName LastName Lecturer(s) (include chapter name/link in parentheses if only for specific chapters) -
