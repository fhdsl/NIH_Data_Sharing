[["index.html", "Data Management and Sharing for NIH Proposals About this Course", " Data Management and Sharing for NIH Proposals March 06, 2024 About this Course The National Institutes of Health (NIH) policy for the management and sharing of scientific data applies for (most) grants submitted. The main requirement of this new policy is that researchers include a Data Management and Sharing (DMS) plan with their proposal. Not all research will require data sharing. However, everyone must provide a justification if they can’t share their data. Once a DMS plan is accepted by the funding agency, the researchers will be required to carry out the plan. However, updates can be made to the plan as well during the Just-in-Time process. In this course we will describe what the new policy requires, places where you might want to share your particular kind of data, and how to deal with possible challenges associated with the policy. Disclaimer These materials have been developed at Fred Hutch for the purpose of assisting our faculty scientists with the new NIH data sharing policy requirements. While we are confident in the content of these materials, we make no guarantee that they will fully comply with NIH’s policy. This is a new policy, and only time will tell. We will revise these materials on an on-going basis, as appropriate. "],["video-summary.html", "Video Summary", " Video Summary Check out the video below.

As of January 23, 2023, the NIH is requiring all grant proposals include a Data Management and Sharing Plan to aid in the transparency and reproducibility of NIH-funded research. Does this apply to me? This will apply to most NIH grants that create data (regardless of funding level), although some grant mechanisms and some data are exempt. It is not required to share all data, however a justification is required. Reasons not to share that are acceptable may be ethical, technical, or legal. Where should I share my data? The NIH has lists of suggested repositories, to help you find appropriate repositories for your data. If there is not an appropriate repository, you can share your data at an institutional (if available) or generalist repository. How do I budget this? You may request funds for data management and sharing as direct costs (including personnel costs). Infrastructure costs should only be included as indirect costs. How do I write my plan? Your plan should be &lt; 2 pages (without hyperlinks) and include sections on data type; tools, software, and code; standards; data preservation, access, and timelines; access, distribution, and reuse considerations; and oversight. You may be able to change your plan in the just-in-time process or during regular reporting intervals. Changes require approval. Will my plan influence my grant score? Although the Data Management and Sharing Plan is a mandatory part of most grant proposals, it will not be shared with reviewers and thus will not influence your score, however the budget will be visible to reviewers. Final Considerations This is a new policy for the NIH and they are expecting to have some growing pains. While they don’t currently have specific expectations, the NIH has stated they will learn from the process as it happens along with the scientists submitting grant proposals under the new policies. In general, it’s best to be mindful of what is actually feasible when it comes to managing and storing your data and try not overstate what you might be able to do. 0.6 Authors This course was developed by the Fred Hutch Data Science Lab.

"],["why-this-new-dms-policy.html", "Chapter 2 Why This New DMS Policy 2.1 Key terms", " Chapter 2 Why This New DMS Policy First, we will discuss the motivations behind the new data management and sharing policy. This policy is applicable for (most) grant proposals submitted to the NIH as of January 25, 2023. Why is the NIH doing this? There are several reasons why sharing data can be beneficial to the scientific community. Transparency - Sharing data provides more clarity about how studies are performed. Many scientists also believe in an ethical responsibility to study participants (Bauchner, Golub, and Fontanarosa 2016). Reproducibility and rigor - Having the data accessible allows others to try to reproduce study findings. This can further enable studies that may replicate or validate the initial findings with different data. Multi-modal work - Scientists can perform studies using multiple types of data when this data is easily accessible (Thessen 2021). Efficiency and cost effectiveness - Some data are especially difficult or expensive to produce. Resources that might have been used to regenerate the data can be used elsewhere. Researcher Inclusion - Data generation can be especially difficult for those at institutes with fewer resources. Publicly available data can therefore be used by these researchers to better enable their participation. Impact - Papers that share their data in repositories appear to be cited more often based on the study by Colavizza et al. (2020) . Collaboration opportunities - Available data can inspire other researchers to explore new directions or extend upon previous work. These researchers might reach out to collaborate. Data citations - Due to the importance of data generation and sharing to the NIH, data will now be seen as research product that demonstrates a contribution to the scientific community. 2.1 Key terms Data Management The work involved with validating, organizing, protecting, maintaining, and processing scientific data to ensure the accessibility, reliability, and quality of the scientific data for use in research. All research data should be actively managed. Data Sharing The act of making scientific data available for use by others (e.g., the larger research community, institutions, the broader public), for example, via an established repository. Some data carry limitations on how data sharing can be done and some meet criteria that make them exempt from data sharing. Metadata Data that provide additional information intended to make scientific data interpretable and reusable. Metadata can include features like dates, independent sample and variable construction and description, methodology, data provenance, data transformations, any intermediate or descriptive observational variables. Data Management and Sharing Plan A plan describing an approach to data management, preservation, and sharing of scientific data and accompanying metadata.

"],["video-your-considerations.html", "Chapter 4 Video Your Considerations", " Chapter 4 Video Your Considerations Check out the video below. It provides a summary of the personal considerations to keep in mind as you are developing your proposal and a DMS Plan. "],["how-will-this-policy-affect-me.html", "Chapter 5 How Will This Policy Affect Me 5.1 Grant Mechanisms 5.2 Grant Renewals 5.3 Impact on Reviews 5.4 Sharing Timeline 5.5 When to Not Share Data", " Chapter 5 How Will This Policy Affect Me You can refer to the NIH overview of which research will be covered by this new policy. The major requirement of the policy is that all grant proposals (submitted after January 25th, 2023) for mechanisms that require compliance, must include a plan for how they will manage and share their data. For certain grant mechanisms for projects that do not generate data, you will not need to submit a DMS plan. For certain types of data, sharing is not possible, and a justification will be required instead. The following text will discuss several key questions: Is my research exempt from the policy? Does my research generate scientific data? Do grant renewals require compliance with the policy? How will the policy impact the review process? When do I need to share my data? When should I not share data? To determine if your research requires compliance with other policies that may influence how you share your data, take this quiz. In addition to these questions, there are ethical considerations that you may want to think about. See the ethics section of the appendix for more information. 5.1 Grant Mechanisms What grant mechanisms require compliance with the DMS policy? The DMS Policy applies to all research that generates scientific data (regardless of the funding level), including: Research Projects Some Career Development Awards (K) Small Business SBIR/STTR Research Centers The DMS Policy does not apply to research and other activities that do not generate scientific data, including: Training (T) Fellowships (F) Construction (C06) Conference Grants (R13) Resource (G) Research-Related Infrastructure Programs (e.g., S06) You can look up your NIH Activity Code here to see if you are required to submit a DMS Plan. For example, I am interested in applying to a R03 award. According to the table, a DMS Plan is required for this particular award. 5.1.1 Data-generating Research Does my research generate scientific data? The NIH Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Policy applies to all NIH-supported research generating scientific data. But what is “scientific data”? 5.1.1.1 Scientific data Scientific data are the “recorded factual material of sufficient quality to validate and replicate research findings, regardless of whether the data are used to support scholarly publications”. This can include any of the following if they are applicable to your study: unpublished results null results results used to publish papers 5.1.1.2 Not Scientific Data You are not expected to share: lab notebooks preliminary analyses case report forms drafts of scientific papers plans for future research peer reviews communications with colleagues physical objects (such as biospecimens) 5.2 Grant Renewals Do grant renewals need to comply with the policy? If you submit a grant renewal application for any of the grants mechanisms that require compliance after January 25th, 2023, then your renewal will need to include a DMS Plan even if the grant was originally funded before January 25th, 2023. 5.3 Impact on Reviews How will this influence the grant review process? For most proposals – those where data sharing is not part of the Funding Opportunity Announcement – the following will happen during the review process: Reviewers will not have access to your DMS plan. Reviewers will however see your budget which will include some descriptions of how money will be spent to manage and share data. Thus, the DMS plan should not influence your grant score. After a grant receives a fundable score, a Program Officer will review the DMS plan and will work with the PI to address any concerns. Changes based on this process can be made during the Just-in-Time procedures. For proposals where data sharing is specified as part of the Funding Opportunity Announcement the following will happen during the review process: The reviewers will have access to the plan and it may be part of the review criteria. Program staff will also review the DMS plan. 5.4 Sharing Timeline When does the data need to be shared by? Data should be made available no later than publication or end of the award. This means that data underlying findings that are not published in peer-reviewed journals should be made available by the end of the award. 5.4.1 No-cost Extensions Scientific data should be made accessible as soon as possible, and no later than the time of an associated publication or the end of the performance period of the extramural award that generated the data. If a no cost extension is granted for an extramural award, scientific data should be made accessible no later than the time of an associated publication, or the end of the no cost extension, whichever comes first. 5.5 When to Not Share Data Is it possible to not share data? There are legitimate reasons you might not share your data. Data might not be shareable due to ethical, legal, or technical concerns. You will still need to submit a DMS Plan even if you plan to withhold data sharing. You must explain your reasoning in your DMS Plan. Justifiable ethical, legal, and technical factors for limiting sharing of data include: Informed consent will not permit or will limit the scope or extent of sharing and future research use Existing consent (e.g., for previously collected biospecimens) prohibits sharing or limits the scope or extent of sharing and future research use Privacy or safety of research participants would be compromised or place them at greater risk of re-identification or suffering harm, and protective measures such as de-identification and Certificates of Confidentiality would be insufficient. At Fred Hutch, you should get in contact with the Institutional Review Office if you have questions about compliance of your research. Explicit federal, state, local, or Tribal law, regulation, or policy prohibits disclosure Restrictions are imposed by existing or anticipated agreements with other parties Datasets cannot practically be digitized with reasonable efforts For additional information about potential ethical considerations, including if data is of sufficient quality to be shared, see the ethics section of the appendix. What if my data are proprietary? (click for more information) Considerations for Proprietary Data (directly from the NIH) NIH understands that some scientific data generated with NIH funds may be proprietary. Under the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Program Policy Directive, effective May 2, 2019, SBIR and STTR awardees may withhold applicable data for 20 years after the award date, as stipulated in the specific SBIR/STTR funding agreement and consistent with achieving program goals. SBIR and STTR awardees are expected to submit a Data Management &amp; Sharing Plan per DMS Policy requirements. Issues related to proprietary data also can arise when co-funding is provided by the private sector (for example, the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries). NIH recognizes that the extent of data sharing may be limited by restrictions imposed by licensing limitations attached to materials needed to conduct the research. Applicants should discuss projects with proposed collaborators early to avoid agreements that prohibit or unnecessarily restrict data sharing. NIH staff will evaluate the justifications of investigators who believe that they are unable to share data. For questions or concerns about data sharing expectations for proprietary data, please contact the Office of Science Policy. Small businesses may wish to contact the NIH SEED Office. Some additional reasons to limit sharing: NIH respects Tribal sovereignty and supports responsible management/sharing of American Indian / Alaska Native participant data, which can include limiting sharing SBIR/STTR Program Policy Directive permits withholding data for 20 years, as stipulated in agreements and consistent with program goals The following are NOT good reasons to limit the sharing of your data: Data are considered too small Researchers anticipate data will not be widely used Data are not thought to have a suitable repository You don’t have the right personnel to manage data or share data You don’t want to pay for data storage "],["video-introduction-wrap-up.html", "Chapter 6 Video Introduction Wrap Up", " Chapter 6 Video Introduction Wrap Up Check out the video below.

"],["overview-of-the-dms-plan.html", "Chapter 8 Overview of the DMS Plan", " Chapter 8 Overview of the DMS Plan The NIH has provided an outline for what components of the Data Sharing and Management Plan are required. We’ll introduce these sections and then discuss in more detail some of the important considerations you’ll need to include in your specific plan. The following are the major sections of the NIH DMS plan: Data type - describe what data (amount and type) will be generated over the course of funding and what data will or will not be shared Tools, software, and code - describe what tools (and versions) you intend to use to manage and analyze the data (note code is not required to be shared) Standards - describe any standards that you might need to use for your data and metadata to make them usable by others or be contributed to a repository Data preservation, access, timelines - describe where the data will be made available and when Access, distribution, reuse considerations - describe how you have carefully considered any reasons that might limit sharing Oversight - describe who will manage compliance of the DMS plan We will cover specific requirements for each of these sections later. However, before starting to write your plan, it may be helpful to consider the data types and size you plan to generate, the repositories available, and the corresponding budgetary implications prior. "],["data-management-and-storage.html", "Chapter 9 Data Management and Storage 9.1 Data Storage Concerns 9.2 Data Repositories 9.3 Considerations for Human Data 9.4 No Existing Repository? 9.5 Summary", " Chapter 9 Data Management and Storage To enable a more productive research experience and to ease your future compliance with any data sharing requirements, active data management during the research process can be very helpful. 9.1 Data Storage Concerns How should you store and interact with data while doing research? Your data storage needs will depend greatly on the type of data you will be working with as well as the number of samples you might have. File sizes vary considerably based on the data being stored. A single file can be as small as 1 MB in size (for a PET scan image of the heart) to 60 GB (for an uncompressed fastq of a whole genome sequence). Storing files in a compressed format, especially raw files, can help decrease your storage needs and costs. Below is a table of common types of data and sizes for single files. This list is not comprehensive but instead should be taken as a general guide. You should always get a more specific estimate for your particular project before submitting your grant proposal. Type of data Common size for a single file Genomics (WGS, WES) 15-60 GB Genomics (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq) 3-25 GB Imaging (microscopy) 2-8 MB Imaging (human medical) 1 MB – 2.5 GB Flow cytometry 1-50 MB Proteomics 3-5 MB Clinical trials 2-25 MB As you can see some of these data types require large data files. These files may quickly add up to require more storage or computing capacity than your laptop (which typically have 250 GB-1 TB of storage)! If you want to learn more about data file sizes check out the data file size details section of the appendix and this class on Computing for Cancer Informatics from the Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) Training Network (ITN) for options on how to manage large data files. 9.2 Data Repositories Where will I share my data? What repositories exist that might work for my data type? Some programs or Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOA) will specify where the data should be shared. If this applies, you should plan to use the repositories mentioned in the FOA. Other programs or FOAs will not specify where the data should be shared, however the NIH provides an interactive table of NIH-supported data repositories to help you identify repositories that might be appropriate for your data. If you don’t find a repository there, additional repositories can also be found at the following links: Open NIH-supported domain-specific repositories Other NIH-supported domain-specific resources Nature data sharing resources Registry of research data repositories Researchers should aim to find repository with the following characteristics according to the NIH: Established: If the repository is established (well-known or has been around for a significant period of time), it is likely to improve the FAIRness (Wilkinson et al. 2016) of the data. Specific: Repositories that are discipline or data-type specific should be prioritized to promote reuse. Unique Persistent Identifiers: Assigns datasets a citable, unique persistent identifier, such as a digital object identifier (DOI) or accession number, to support data discovery, reporting, and research assessment. The identifier points to a persistent landing page that remains accessible even if the dataset is de-accessioned or no longer available. Long-Term Sustainability: Has a plan for long-term management of data, including maintaining integrity, authenticity, and availability of datasets; building on a stable technical infrastructure and funding plans; and having contingency plans to ensure data are available and maintained during and after unforeseen events. Metadata: Ensures datasets are accompanied by metadata to enable discovery, reuse, and citation of datasets, using schema that are appropriate to, and ideally widely used across, the community/communities the repository serves. Domain-specific repositories would generally have more detailed metadata than generalist repositories. Curation and Quality Assurance: Provides, or has a mechanism for others to provide, expert curation and quality assurance to improve the accuracy and integrity of datasets and metadata. Free and Easy Access: Provides broad, equitable, and maximally open access to datasets and their metadata free of charge in a timely manner after submission, consistent with legal and ethical limits required to maintain privacy and confidentiality, Tribal sovereignty, and protection of other sensitive data. Broad and Measured Reuse: Makes datasets and their metadata available with broadest possible terms of reuse; and provides the ability to measure attribution, citation, and reuse of data (i.e., through assignment of adequate metadata and unique identifiers). Clear Use Guidance: Provides accompanying documentation describing terms of dataset access and use (e.g., particular licenses, need for approval by a data use committee). Security and Integrity: Has documented measures in place to meet generally accepted criteria for preventing unauthorized access to, modification of, or release of data, with levels of security that are appropriate to the sensitivity of data. Confidentiality: Has documented capabilities for ensuring that administrative, technical, and physical safeguards are employed to comply with applicable confidentiality, risk management, and continuous monitoring requirements for sensitive data (should your data require such safeguards). Common Format: Allows datasets and metadata downloaded, accessed, or exported from the repository to be in widely used, preferably non-proprietary, formats consistent with those used in the community/communities the repository serves. Provenance: Has mechanisms in place to record the origin, chain of custody, and any modifications to submitted datasets and metadata. Retention Policy: Provides documentation on policies for data retention within the repository. 9.3 Considerations for Human Data When working with human participant data, including de-identified human data, here are some additional characteristics to look for: Fidelity to Consent: Uses documented procedures to restrict dataset access and use to those that are consistent with participant consent and changes in consent. Restricted Use Compliant: Uses documented procedures to communicate and enforce data use restrictions, such as preventing reidentification or redistribution to unauthorized users. Privacy: Implements and provides documentation of measures (for example, tiered access, credentialing of data users, security safeguards against potential breaches) to protect human subjects data from inappropriate access. Plan for Breach: Has security measures that include a response plan for detected data breaches. Download Control: Controls and audits access to and download of datasets (if download is permitted). Violations: Has procedures for addressing violations of terms-of-use by users and data mismanagement by the repository. Request Review: Makes use of an established and transparent process for reviewing data access requests. Data FAIRness Data that is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. For more information about data FAIRness, check out this manuscript by Wilkinson et al. (2016). In brief, it is described by the NIH as follows: To be Findable, data must have unique identifiers, effectively labeling it within searchable resources. To be Accessible, data must be easily retrievable via open systems and effective and secure authentication and authorization procedures. To be Interoperable, data should “use and speak the same language” via use of standardized vocabularies. To be Reusable, data must be adequately described to a new user, have clear information about data-usage licenses, and have a traceable “owner’s manual,” or provenance. 9.4 No Existing Repository? What if I can’t find an appropriate repository? Supplemental material - If the data are small (less than 2 GB), it may be included as supplemental material for an article. See here for more information. Institutional repositories - Check to see if your institute has a repository where you could publicly share the data Generalist repositories- Host your data somewhere that hosts different types of data publicly, such as: Dataverse Dryad Figshare IEEE Dataport Mendeley Data Open Science Framework Synapse Vivli Zenodo Note that the NIH encourages that an existing data sharing repository be used whenever one is available instead of one of these options. 9.5 Summary The following links can help you find a data repository for your data: Interactive table of NIH-supported data repositories Start here!

You can refer to the NIH overview about budgeting for this policy of which research will be covered by this new policy. 10.1 Allowable Costs You can request funding for costs related to your data including personnel and fees associated with: Curating the data (but not gaining access or collecting) Local data management before sharing Developing supporting documentation Standardizing the data Preparing the metadata to be findable, accessible, interpretable, and reusable (FAIR) Formatting the data for storage in a repository Transmission of the data from local storage to a repository De-identification of the data Data deposit fees for storing data in a repository to share the data for a specific amount of time If a DMS plan states that the data will be shared for 10 years in a repository, then the costs for the entire 10 years needs to be paid prior to the end of the funding award period (period of performance) - this includes scientific data or metadata that is shared after the award period. If the DMS plan states that the data will be shared in multiple repositories, the costs for each repository can be included in the budget. You can refer to the NIH Supplemental Information for Allowable Costs for more information. If you have questions, you can email: SciencePolicy@od.nih.gov 10.2 Unallowable costs The following costs are not allowed in the budget: Infrastructure costs (for example facilities and administrative costs should be indirect costs) Costs related to gaining access to the data Costs related to collecting the data 10.3 Budget Implementation To request funds for data management and sharing: Direct costs should use the R&amp;R Budget Form. A single line item should appear in section F “Other Direct Costs” Budget justification should provide a brief summary of the DMS plan and costs. Use PHS 398 Modular Budget Form (as text embedded within the Additional Narrative Justification) and the R&amp;R Budget Form (embedded within the section L “Budget Justification” attachment) Check that any related costs for other data policies like the Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) Policy are also included See additional guidance at the NIH Implementation Details for this policy 10.4 Assessment of Budget Peer reviewers will have access to the budget justification but not the DMS Plan Peer reviewers may provide comments on the reasonableness of the budget These comments will not impact the score Don’t double up requests for direct and indirect support Activities that get supported must happen during project period (for example if storing data for 10 years, you must pay for all of those years in advance) "],["writing-a-dms-plan.html", "Chapter 11 Writing a DMS Plan 11.1 DMS Helper App 11.2 Plan Sections 11.3 General Requirements 11.4 Data Type 11.5 Related Tools, Software and/or Code 11.6 Standards 11.7 Repositories and Timelines 11.8 Access and Reuse Considerations 11.9 Oversight", " Chapter 11 Writing a DMS Plan In this section we will guide you through the requirements for the various sections of the DMS plan.

It includes template text corresponding to different Fred Hutch Research Cores. You can download your filled-in plan in either Word or Markdown format. https://dmshelper.fredhutch.org/ If you are not familiar with the plan’s sections, we recommend reading on below before diving into the DMS Helper App. 11.2 Plan Sections These following are the major sections of the plan: Data type - describe what data (amount and type) will be generated over the course of funding and what data will or will not be shared Tools, software, and code - describe what tools (and versions) you intend to use to manage and analyze the data (note code is not required to be shared) Standards - describe any standards that you might need to use for your data and metadata to make them usable by others or be contributed to a repository Data preservation, access, timelines - describe where the data will be made available and when Access, distribution, reuse considerations - describe how you have carefully considered any reasons that might limit sharing Oversight - describe who will manage compliance of the DMS plan 11.3 General Requirements ✅ The plan must be less than 2 pages and do not include hyperlinks. Follow margin and font formatting restrictions consistent with the rest of the proposal. ✅ Nothing confidential or proprietary is in your plan. Initially DMS plans will not be made public, but they may be made public in the future. You are encouraged to talk to the appropriate Program Officer for your respective funding announcement about your plan before you submit your grant proposal. Keep in mind that your DMS plan will not be reviewed by reviewers, only the budget sections in regard to this will be seen by them. Instead the Program Officer will review your DMS plan to determine if it is reasonable and appropriate or if you need to make changes. 11.4 Data Type 11.4.1 Types and amount data ✅ Describe what kind of data will be generated over the course of funding. ✅ Describe the expected amounts of data for each kind of data. ✅ Describe the expected levels of aggregation (individual, aggregated, summarized) for each kind of data. ✅ Describe the expected degree of processing of data for each kind of data. 11.4.2 Data Sharing ✅ Describe what data from the project will shared or not shared and justify this decision. For additional information about potential ethical considerations of sharing your data, see the ethics section of the appendix. 11.4.3 Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation ✅ List information about metadata.   ✅ List other possibly relevant data. This includes data you think is not considered scientific. ✅ List any relevant information about how you plan to gather the data. For example, this could include study protocols and data collection instruments that you plan to share to make it easier for others to reproduce your work. Click here for more requirements for data subject to the Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) policy. Data types expected to be shared under the GDS Policy should be described in this element. Note that the GDS Policy expects certain types of data to be shared that may not be covered by the DMS Policy’s definition of “scientific data”. For more information on the data types to be shared under the GDS Policy, consult Data Submission and Release Expectations. 11.5 Related Tools, Software and/or Code ✅ Describe any software or code you intend to use to process or analyze the data. Provide the names of the tools. Provide how the tools can be accessed. Provide version number of tools and operating systems expected to be used. Provide how long they will be available (if known). 11.6 Standards ✅ Describe the names of any data standards that will be used for your data/metadata to enable easier sharing are repeated use of your data. This could include: data formats metadata schemas content/encoding standards standard terminologies common data elements data dictionaries data identifiers definitions unique identifiers other data documentation ✅ Describe how these standards will be applied to your data.   ✅ If no standards exist, justify this. Data Standard An agreed upon set of rules that allow information to be shared and processed in a uniform and consistent manner. This includes representations, formats, and definitions of data. Standards vary by discipline. An extensive list of standards you can search can be found here. An example standard is the MIAME reporting guideline for microarray experiments. Keep in mind that there may be important ethical considerations when it comes to data standards, see the ethics section on standards of the appendix. 11.7 Repositories and Timelines Researchers are expected to try to maximize data sharing while still respecting sharing limitations or restrictions. See the next section if you feel that you have limitations for sharing your data. Click here for more requirements for data subject to the Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) policy. For human genomic data: Investigators are expected to submit data to a repository acceptable under the Genomic Data Sharing Policy. See Where to Submit Genomic Data. Human genomic data is expected to be shared according to NIH’s Data Submission and Release Expectations, but no later than the end of the performance period, whichever comes first. For Non-human genomic data: Investigators may submit data to any widely used repository. Non-human genomic data is expected to be shared as soon as possible, but no later than the time of an associated publication, or end of the performance period, whichever is first. 11.7.1 List where the data will be shared ✅ Describe the repositories for sharing the scientific data, as well as the metadata. 11.7.2 Methods to make scientific data findable and identifiable ✅ Describe what you will do to make the data more findable and identifiable. For example, you could use a persistent unique identifier (PID) or other standard indexing tool. Zenodo can be a useful option for creating digital object identifiers (DOIs). 11.7.3 Timeline of scientific data sharing ✅ Describe when the scientific data will be made available to others. Recall that data must be shared no later than the time of publication of findings or the end of the award (whatever comes first), however the NIH encourages th the data be shared as early as possible. Renewals can have an updated DMS plan with a different timeline, but if not approved must use previous DMS date. No cost extension also allows for more time. NIH encourages that data be made available as early as possible. ✅ Describe how long data will be available to others. There is no requirement for how long need to be available, however, note that journals may have requirements and the NIH encourages that data be made available for as long as the data is anticipated to be useful. Furthermore, Per Section 8.4.2 of the NIH Grants Policy Statement, grantee institutions are required to keep data for 3 years following closeout of a grant or contract agreement. Additionally, specific awards may have their own requirements. ✅ Describe any differences in timelines for different datasets. 11.8 Access and Reuse Considerations Describe how you considered various factors that may influence data access or hinder your ability to share the data including:   ✅ Describe type of informed consent was used or will be used to gather the data. NIH expects informed consent for de-identified cell lines or clinical specimens as well (even if the research does not meet the definition of “human subjects research” under the Common Rule for all data derived from such specimens after January 25th, 2015, the effective date of the GDS policy. ✅ Describe if access to data related to human subjects will be controlled and how the privacy, rights and confidentiality of these participants will be protected (for example, de-identification methods).   ✅ Ensure privacy and confidentiality protections consistent with applicable federal, Tribal, state, and local laws, regulations, and policies.   ✅ Describe any restrictions imposed by federal, Tribal, or state laws, regulations, or policies, or existing or anticipated agreements.   ✅ Describe any other relevant data sharing policies. An example could be the Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) policy. If indeed the data requires compliance with the GDS policy, researchers should indicate if the study should be designated as “sensitive”. ✅ Describe any reasons that will limit data sharing (including legal, ethical, or technical concerns, as well as Institutional Certification limitations).   Other sharing limitations: This could be because datasets cannot practically be digitized with reasonable efforts, or that privacy or safety of research participants would be compromised or place them at greater risk of re-identification. If data cannot be shared due to an Institutional Certification criteria, for example, the data cannot be shared as expected by the GDS policy. Researchers should include this information in their DMS plan and explain why the element cannot be met. ✅ Describe any consideration for embargo periods or access controls if there are intellectual property concerns, rather than refraining from sharing altogether. Keep in mind that there may be important ethical considerations when it comes to sharing data based on the consent process, see the ethics consent section of the appendix. In addition, de-identification can be a tricky process, see the ethics section for more information about that as well. 11.9 Oversight ✅ Describe who will manage compliance with the DMS plan (include names, titles and roles of all individuals involved).   ✅ Describe how compliance will be monitored (including frequency of oversight, for example every 3 months).

If you’d like to learn more about the basics of data sizes and computing capacity, please take a look at this class on Computing for Cancer Informatics from the Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) Training Network (ITN). Genomics Data Matt Fitzgibbon and Andy Marty from Genomics Shared Resources have put together a table of file sizes generated by common genomics assays done at Fred Hutch. These estimates are only approximate, as the actual file sizes can vary considerably. Per-samples sizes are averaged from samples of at least three representative runs of the given type (except for 10x Multiome where two runs were checked).

These are some general estimates you can use as a guideline when considering your data management and storage needs. These tables are borrowed from the ITN Computing for Cancer Informatics Course. Here is an table of average file sizes for various medical imaging modalities from Liu et al. (2017): [source] Note that depending on the study requirements, several images may be needed for each sample. Thus data storage needs can add up quickly. [source] Clinical Data This information is borrowed from the ITN Computing for Cancer Informatics Course. Really large clinical datasets can also produce sizable file sizes. For example the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS) contains data on more than seven million hospital stays in the United States with regional information. According to the NIS website it “enables analyses of rare conditions, uncommon treatments, and special populations” (“NIS Database Documentation” n.d.). Looking at the file sizes for the NIS data for different states across years, you can see that there are files for some states, such as California as large as 24,000 MB or 2.4 GB (“NIS Database Documentation” n.d.). You can see how this could add up across years and states quite quickly. "],["ethics.html", "Ethical Considerations Consent De-identification Raw vs Processed Data Data Standards Data Quality Additional Resources", " Ethical Considerations In this section, we would like to point out that there may be some aspects to consider in terms of the consequences of how you manage or share your data. This is a new policy, so it isn’t quite clear yet what should be done in all circumstances. Here we propose some of our thoughts about aspects we think might require extra consideration. We do not have all the answers and are open to any feedback or thoughts you have on this topic. Please use the feedback button at the bottom of the table of contents to give us your feedback. Consent Make sure that the consent process for data collection allows for sharing the data in the way that you have planned. If you have consent to share the data, the data may still be consented to only be used for certain research purposes. Be careful that the data are shared in a way that reflects this. For example, it may be necessary to only share the data in a repository that requires people submit for access in which they describe what they plan to do with the data. De-identification You don’t technically have to de-identify data in order to share it. You need to go through the process with the Internal Review Board (IRB) and consent review to identify under what conditions the data CAN be shared. Those conditions may be very limiting but usually are not full “cannot be shared” restrictions. If you end up using de-identification methods, it is often recommended that you consult an an expert to ensure that the privacy of the research participants is protected as de-identification can be trickier than expected. Raw vs Processed Data You may be wondering what data you should share - the totally raw data or the processed data? Perhaps one should think about what level of effort/funding/resources would be necessary to make data easy for someone to use, since slightly processed data while less convenient for working from scratch takes up less space/uses less resources. Indeed people may generally want to reuse a slightly processed version of the data, but we also want to consider the option of giving people access to raw data, as accepted processing methods may change in the future. Likely it might be ideal to aim for a balance between making it easy for others to reuse the data, while being conscious of what is required to do so. Data Standards Data standards are especially important for helping to make your data more easily reusable. As technology advances, it is important that we report enough information about how our data is collected so that others can use it effectively in the future. This is an extra need for this sort of consideration if you are working with a data type this from an especially new technology or field. Ideally our standards should be flexible to the evolution of the technology we are working with. For example, we may discover that a certain library preparation method for a type of sequencing data had a specific bias in the future, thus reporting this information may become vital for the reuse of the data. Additionally, in considering establishing new standards, it may be helpful to consider how to make the data more usable across disciplines for researchers who may want to work with multiple types of data. Data Quality What quality threshold is really needed to share data? What are the consequences of sharing poor-quality data? What are the consequences of not sharing data that is of reasonable quality that someone decided was poor quality? These questions probably require case-by-case considerations. If the data was used for a publication, then we would imagine it is of high enough quality to be shared. However if the data was produced in the process of your work (but not used for your ultimate findings) and it might not be as helpful to others, maybe it doesn’t need to be shared, especially if the quality is not as high as you would like. For example, you might have recorded data while an instrument was malfunctioning. If you change your data sharing plans based on data quality, you would need to discuss with the program officer. Additional Resources The Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications of genetics and genomics (ELSI) Hub can be a helpful resource for your ethical concerns regarding sharing genomics data.
