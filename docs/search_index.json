The main requirement of this new policy is that researchers include a Data Management and Sharing (DMS) plan with their proposal. Not all research will require data sharing. However, everyone must provide a justification if they can’t share their data. Once a DMS plan is accepted by the funding agency, the researchers will be required to carry out the plan. However, updates can be made to the plan as well during the Just-in-Time process. In this course we will describe what the new policy requires, places where you might want to share your particular kind of data, and how to deal with possible challenges associated with the policy. 0.1 Motivation Navigating the new NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy - https://sharing.nih.gov/ - can be confusing. We want to help make the process of compliance with this new policy easier. 0.2 Target Audience The course is intended for anyone who plans to submit a grant proposal to the NIH after January 25th, 2023. 0.3 Curriculum The course will cover: Motivations behind the new policy Overview of the new policy requirements and how it may affect you Suggestions about where to share your data Recommendations about how to budget for your data Guidance about how to write a DMS plan Information on how to submit the DMS plan to funding agencies Guidance on how to update a DMS plan after submission or funding General tips and frequently asked questions 0.4 Authors This course was developed by the Fred Hutch Data Science Lab.

First we will discuss the motivations behind the new data management and sharing policy that will go into effect for (most) grant proposals submitted to the NIH after January 25, 2023. So why is the NIH doing this? There are several reasons why sharing data can be beneficial to the scientific community. Supports transparency - Sharing data provides more clarity about how studies are performed. Many scientists also believe in an ethical responsibility to study participants (Bauchner, Golub, and Fontanarosa 2016). Encourages reproducibility and rigor - Having the data accessible, allows others to try to reproduce study findings. This can further enable studies that may replicate or validate the initial findings with different data. Supports multi-modal work - When more data of various types are easily available it makes it easier for scientist to perform studies with multiple types of data (Thessen 2021). More efficient and cost effective - Some data are especially difficult or expensive to produce. Supports Researcher Inclusion - Data generation can be especially difficult for those at institutes with less resources. Publicly available data can therefore be used by these researchers to better enable their participation. Increased impact - Papers that share their data in repositories appear to be cited more based on the study by Colavizza et al. (2020) . Increased collaboration opportunity - Having data available can encourage other researchers to expand the research in a new direction or extend it further and they may reach out to collaborate. Data Citations - Due to the importance of data generation and sharing to the NIH, data will now be seen as research product that demonstrates a contribution to the scientific community. 1.1 Key terms Data Management The work involved with validating, organizing, protecting, maintaining, and processing scientific data to ensure the accessibility, reliability, and quality of the scientific data for its users. All data should be managed. Data Sharing The act of making scientific data available for use by others (e.g., the larger research community, institutions, the broader public), for example, via an established repository. Some data meet criteria to be exempt from data sharing. Metadata Data that provide additional information intended to make scientific data interpretable and reusable (e.g., date, independent sample and variable construction and description, methodology, data provenance, data transformations, any intermediate or descriptive observational variables). Data Management and Sharing Plan (Plan) A plan describing the data management, preservation, and sharing of scientific data and accompanying metadata.

You can refer to the NIH overview of which research will be covered by this new policy. The major requirement of the policy is that all grant proposals (submitted after January 25th, 2023) for mechanisms that require compliance, must include a plan for how they will manage and share their data. For certain grant mechanisms for projects that do not generate data, compliance with the policy is not required. For certain types of data, sharing is not possible, and a justification will be required instead. The following outline several key questions: Is my research exempt from the policy? Does my research generate scientific data? If yes, you will need to submit a DMS Plan. When do I need to share my data? Can I elect to not share data? The short answer is yes. However, you must still justify this choice in a submitted DMS Plan. 2.1 What grant mechanisms don’t require compliance with the DMS policy? The DMS Policy applies to all research that generates scientific data, including: Research Projects Some Career Development Awards (K) Small Business SBIR/STTR Research Centers The DMS Policy does not apply to research and other activities that do not generate scientific data, including: Training (T) Fellowships (F) Construction (C06) Conference Grants (R13) Resource (G) Research-Related Infrastructure Programs (e.g., S06) You can look up your NIH Activity Code here to see if you are required to submit a DMS Plan. For example, I am interested in applying to a R03 award. According to the table, a DMS Plan is required for this particular award. 2.2 Does my research generate scientific data? The NIH Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Policy applies to all NIH-supported research generating scientific data. But what is “scientific data”? 2.2.1 Scientific data Scientific data are the “recorded factual material of sufficient quality to validate and replicate research findings, regardless of whether the data are used to support scholarly publications”. This can include any of the following if they are applicable to your study: unpublished results null results results used to publish papers 2.2.2 Not scientific data You are not expected to share: lab notebooks preliminary analyses case report forms drafts of scientific papers plans for future research peer reviews communications with colleagues physical objects (such as biospecimens) 2.3 What is the timeline for sharing data? Data should be made available no later than publication or end of the award. This means that data underlying findings that are not published in peer-reviewed journals should be made available by the end of the award. 2.3.1 What about no cost extensions? Scientific data should be made accessible as soon as possible, and no later than the time of an associated publication or the end of the performance period of the extramural award that generated the data. If a no cost extension is granted for an extramural award, scientific data should be made accessible no later than the time of an associated publication, or the end of the no cost extension, whichever comes first. 2.3.2 What about grant renewals? 2.4 Can I elect to not share data? There are legitimate reasons you might not want to share your data. Data might not be shareable due to ethical, legal, or technical concerns. You will still need to submit a DMS Plan even if you plan to withhold data sharing. You must explain your reasoning in your DMS Plan. Justifiable ethical, legal, and technical factors for limiting sharing of data include: Informed consent will not permit or will limit the scope or extent of sharing and future research use Existing consent (e.g., for previously collected biospecimens) prohibits sharing or limits the scope or extent of sharing and future research use Privacy or safety of research participants would be compromised or place them at greater risk of re-identification or suffering harm, and protective measures such as de-identification and Certificates of Confidentiality would be insufficient. At Fred Hutch, you should get in contact with the Institutional Review Office if you have questions about compliance of your research. Explicit federal, state, local, or Tribal law, regulation, or policy prohibits disclosure Restrictions are imposed by existing or anticipated agreements with other parties Datasets cannot practically be digitized with reasonable efforts What if my data are proprietary? (click for more information) Considerations for Proprietary Data (directly from the NIH) NIH understands that some scientific data generated with NIH funds may be proprietary. Under the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Program Policy Directive, effective May 2, 2019, SBIR and STTR awardees may withhold applicable data for 20 years after the award date, as stipulated in the specific SBIR/STTR funding agreement and consistent with achieving program goals. SBIR and STTR awardees are expected to submit a Data Management &amp; Sharing Plan per DMS Policy requirements. Issues related to proprietary data also can arise when co-funding is provided by the private sector (for example, the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries). NIH recognizes that the extent of data sharing may be limited by restrictions imposed by licensing limitations attached to materials needed to conduct the research. Applicants should discuss projects with proposed collaborators early to avoid agreements that prohibit or unnecessarily restrict data sharing. NIH staff will evaluate the justifications of investigators who believe that they are unable to share data. For questions or concerns about data sharing expectations for proprietary data, please contact the Office of Science Policy. Small businesses may wish to contact the NIH SEED Office. Some additional reasons to limit sharing: NIH respects Tribal sovereignty and supports responsible management/sharing of American Indian / Alaska Native participant data, which can include limiting sharing SBIR/STTR Program Policy Directive permits withholding data for 20 years, as stipulated in agreements and consistent with program goals The following are NOT good reasons to limit the sharing of your data: Data are considered too small Researchers anticipate data will not be widely used Data are not thought to have a suitable repository You don’t have the right personnel to manage data or share data You don’t want to pay for data storage "],["data-managementstorage-options.html", "Chapter 3 Data Management/Storage Options 3.1 Data Storage Concerns 3.2 Data Sharing Repositories", " Chapter 3 Data Management/Storage Options 3.1 Data Storage Concerns How you should store and interact with data while doing research. 3.2 Data Sharing Repositories Once you need to share it as part of this policy, what do you do then?

Where to share data? currently no NIH requirements except encouraging established repositories, but this may change link to searchable NIH supported repositories and otherwise encouraged repositories info about other types of data that aren’t covered by these repositories "],["budgeting-for-data-sharing.html", "Chapter 4 Budgeting for Data Sharing 4.1 Allowable Costs 4.2 Unallowable costs 4.3 Budget Implementation 4.4 Assessment of Budget", " Chapter 4 Budgeting for Data Sharing In this section we will describe what you need to think about in terms of how to budget for the management and sharing of your data, as well as what money you can request to help you carry out your DMS plans. You can refer to the NIH overview about budgeting for this policy of which research will be covered by this new policy. 4.1 Allowable Costs You can request funding for costs related to your data including: Curating the data (but not gaining access or collecting) Local data management before sharing Developing supporting documentation Standardizing the data Preparing the metadata to be findable, interpretable, and reusable Formatting the data for storage in a repository Transmission of the data from local storage to a repository De-identification of the data Data deposit fees for storing data in a repository to share the data for a specific amount of time If a DMS plan states that the data will be shared for 10 years in a repository, then the costs for the entire 10 years needs to be paid prior to the end of the funding award period (period of performance) - this includes scientific data or metadata that is shared after the award period. If the DMS plan states that the data will be shared in multiple repositories, the costs for each repository can be included in the budget. You can refer to the NIH Supplemental Information for Allowable Costs for more information. If you have questions, you can email: SciencePolicy@od.nih.gov 4.2 Unallowable costs The following costs are not allowed in the budget: Infrastructure costs (for example facilities and administrative costs should be indirect costs) Costs related to gaining access to the data Costs related to collecting the data 4.3 Budget Implementation To requests for funds for data management and sharing: ☑️ For direct costs - use the R&amp;R Budget Form: single line item in section F. Other Direct Costs ☑️ Budget justification - provide a brief summary of the DMS plan and costs- use PHS 398 Modular Budget Form: as text embedded within the Additional Narrative Justification and the R&amp;R Budget Form: embedded within the section L. Budget Justification attachment ☑️ Check that any related costs for other data policies like the Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) Policy are also included See additional guidance at the NIH Implementation Details for this policy 4.3.1 General tips Don’t double up requests for direct and indirect support Again activities that get supported must happen during project period (for example if storing data for 10 years - must pay for those years in advance) 4.4 Assessment of Budget Peer reviewers will have access to the budget justification but not the DMS Plan Peer reviewers may provide comments on the reasonableness of the budget These comments will not impact the score "],["writing-a-dms-plan.html", "Chapter 5 Writing a DMS Plan 5.1 General Requirements 5.2 Data Type 5.3 Related Tools, Software and/or Code: 5.4 Standards: 5.5 Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines 5.6 Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations 5.7 Oversight 5.8 List of references for your DMS Plan", " Chapter 5 Writing a DMS Plan In this section we will guide you through the general requirements for the various sections of the DMS plan.     These following are the major sections of the plan: Data type - describe what data (amount and type) will be generated over the course of funding and what data will or will not be shared Tools, software, and code (note code is not required to be shared) - describe in what tools you intend to use to manage and analyze the data Standards - describe any standards that you might use for your data and metadata Data preservation, access, timelines - describe where the data will be made available and when Access, distribution, reuse considerations - describe how you have carefully considered any reasons that might limit sharing Oversight - describe who will manage compliance of the DMS plan 5.1 General Requirements ☑️ The plan must be less than 2 pages.   ☑️ Nothing confidential or proprietary is in your plan. Initially DMS plans will not be made public, but they may be made public in the future. 5.2 Data Type 5.2.1 Types and amount data ☑️ Describe what kind of data will be generated over the course of funding. ☑️ Describe the expected amounts of data for each kind of data. 5.2.2 Data Sharing ☑️ Describe what data from the project will shared or not shared and justify this decision. 5.2.3 Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation ☑️ List information about metadata.   ☑️ List other possibly relevant data. This includes data you think is not considered scientific. ☑️ List any relevant information about how you plan to gather the data. For example, this could include study protocols and data collection instruments that you plan to share to make it easier for others to reproduce your work. 5.3 Related Tools, Software and/or Code: ☑️ Describe any software or code you intend to use to process or analyze the data. Provide the names of the tools and how they can be accessed. 5.4 Standards: ☑️ Describe the names of any data standards that will be used for your data/metadata to enable easier sharing are repeated use of your data. This could include: data formats data dictionaries data identifiers definitions unique identifiers other data documentation ☑️ Describe how these standards will be applied to your data.   ☑️ If no standards exist, justify this. Data Standard An agreed upon set of rules that allow information to be shared and processed in a uniform and consistent manner. This includes representations, formats, and definitions of data. Standards vary by discipline. An extensive list of standards you can search can be found here. An example standard is the MIAME reporting guideline for microarray experiments. 5.5 Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines 5.5.1 List where the data will be shared ☑️ Describe the repositories for sharing the scientific data, as well as the metadata. 5.5.2 Methods to make scientific data findable and identifiable ☑️ Describe what you will do to make the data more findable and identifiable. For example, you could use a persistent unique identifier or other standard indexing tool. Zenodo can be a useful option for creating digital object identifiers (DOIs). 5.5.3 Timeline of scientific data sharing: ☑️ Describe when the scientific data will be made available to others. Recall that data must be shared no later than the time of publication of findings or the end of the award (whatever comes first), however the NIH encourages th the data be shared as early as possible. Renewals can have an updated DMS plan with a different timeline, but if not approved must use previous DMS date. No cost extension also allows for more time. ☑️ Describe how long data will be available to others. There is no requirement for how long need to be available, however, note that journals may have requirements and the NIH encourages that data be made available for as long as possible. 5.6 Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations Describe how you considered various factors that may influence data access or hinder your ability to share the data including:   ☑️ Describe type of consent was used or will be used to gather the data.   ☑️ Describe if access to data related to human subjects will be controlled   ☑️ Ensure privacy and confidentiality protections consistent with applicable federal, Tribal, state, and local laws, regulations, and policies.   ☑️ Describe any restrictions imposed by federal, Tribal, or state laws, regulations, or policies, or existing or anticipated agreements   ☑️ Describe any other relevant data sharing policies. An example could be the Genomic Data Sharing Policy. ☑️ Describe any reasons that will limit data sharing. Other sharing limitations: This could be because datasets cannot practically be digitized with reasonable efforts, or that privacy or safety of research participants would be compromised or place them at greater risk of re-identification. 5.7 Oversight ☑️ Describe who will manage compliance with the DMS plan.   ☑️ Describe how compliance will be monitored. 5.8 List of references for your DMS Plan The following are scientific papers that can be referenced in your DMS Plan: Bonomi, Huang, and Ohno-Machado (2020) - The promises and challenges associated with sharing genomic data Cosgriff, Ebner, and Celi (2020) - The promise of shared data for addressing public health emergencies, such as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic McKiernan et al.
