# Budgeting for Data Sharing

how am I going pay this bill?  [reference here](introduction.html#why-this-new-policy)

What if it will cost a lot to share data?
- can request for funding support
    - allowable costs (de-identification, deposition fees)
    - unallowable data (infrastructure costs (this should be indirect costs) and costs related to conducting the research - like gaining access to the data)
    - don't double up requests for direct and indirect support
    - activities that get supported must happen during project period (for example if storing data for 10 years - must pay for those years in advance)
    - budget implementation details
