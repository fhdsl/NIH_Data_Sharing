# Data Management/Storage Options

## Data Storage Concerns
How you should store and interact with data while doing research.  

## Data Sharing Repositories

Once you need to share it as part of this policy, what do you do then?  
What repositories might work for your data type?

What if I don't have one? 

8. Where to share data?
- currently no NIH requirements except encouraging established repositories, but this may change 
- link to searchable NIH supported repositories and otherwise encouraged repositories
- info about other types of data that aren't covered by these repositories
