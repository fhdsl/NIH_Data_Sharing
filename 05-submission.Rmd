# (PART\*) DMS Submission Process {-}

# Pre-Submission Tips

 Implementation details
- other plans field added to forms H filed of the PHS 398 research plan form/career development supplemental form
- Resource sharing plans will not be going away (but will not be about data - tools and model organisms)- instructions will be updated
- No longer separate data sharing or genomic data sharing plans


# Post-Submission Tips


- can update plan if not accepted (just in time)
- can also update during regular reporting intervals - thus need to show that you made a plan but it's OK if things change (but these will need to be approved)
    
 11. Other details
 -Unique persistent identifiers are not required (such as a DOI but they are encouraged)
  
  Investigators are expected to report progress made on data sharing in their Research Progress Performance Report (RPPR).
