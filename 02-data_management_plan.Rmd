# Data Management/Storage Options

## Data Storage Concerns
How you should store and interact with data while doing research.  

## Data Sharing Repositories

Once you need to share it as part of this policy, what do you do then?  
What repositories might work for your data type?

- Some programs or Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOA) will specify where the data should be shared.

- Other programs or FOAs will not specify where the data should be shared, however researchers should aim to find repository with the following characteristics

    - **Establised**: If the repository is established (well-known or has been around for a significant period of time), it is likely to improve the FAIRness of the data. 
    - **Specific** -repositores that are discipline or data-type specific should be priortized to promote reuse.
    - **Unique Persistent Identifiers**: Assigns datasets a citable, unique persistent identifier, such as a digital object identifier (DOI) or accession number, to support data discovery, reporting, and research assessment. The identifier points to a persistent landing page that remains accessible even if the dataset is de-accessioned or no longer available.
    - **Long-Term Sustainability**: Has a plan for long-term management of data, including maintaining integrity, authenticity, and availability of datasets; building on a stable technical infrastructure and funding plans; and having contingency plans to ensure data are available and maintained during and after unforeseen events.
    - **Metadata**: Ensures datasets are accompanied by metadata to enable discovery, reuse, and citation of datasets, using schema that are appropriate to, and ideally widely used across, the community(ies) the repository serves. Domain-specific repositories would generally have more detailed metadata than generalist repositories.
    - **Curation and Quality Assurance**: Provides, or has a mechanism for others to provide, expert curation and quality assurance to improve the accuracy and integrity of datasets and metadata.
    - **Free and Easy Access**: Provides broad, equitable, and maximally open access to datasets and their metadata free of charge in a timely manner after submission, consistent with legal and ethical limits required to maintain privacy and confidentiality, Tribal sovereignty, and protection of other sensitive data.
    - **Broad and Measured Reuse**: Makes datasets and their metadata available with broadest possible terms of reuse; and provides the ability to measure attribution, citation, and reuse of data (i.e., through assignment of adequate metadata and unique PIDs).
    - **Clear Use Guidance**: Provides accompanying documentation describing terms of dataset access and use (e.g., particular licenses, need for approval by a data use committee).
    - **Security and Integrity**: Has documented measures in place to meet generally accepted criteria for preventing unauthorized access to, modification of, or release of data, with levels of security that are appropriate to the sensitivity of data.
    - **Confidentiality**: Has documented capabilities for ensuring that administrative, technical, and physical safeguards are employed to comply with applicable confidentiality, risk management, and continuous monitoring requirements for sensitive data (should your data require such safeguards).
    - **Common Format**: Allows datasets and metadata downloaded, accessed, or exported from the repository to be in widely used, preferably non-proprietary, formats consistent with those used in the community(ies) the repository serves.
    - **Provenance**: Has mechanisms in place to record the origin, chain of custody, and any modifications to submitted datasets and metadata.
    - **Retention Policy**: Provides documentation on policies for data retention within the repository.



<div class = "dictionary">
Data FAIRness - data that is **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, and **R**eusable. For more information about data FAIRness, check out  this [manuscript](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618).

In brief it is described by the [NIH](https://datascience.nih.gov/sites/default/files/NIH_Strategic_Plan_for_Data_Science_Final_508.pdf) as follows:

- To be Findable, data must have unique identifiers, effectively
labeling it within searchable resources.
- To be Accessible, data must be easily retrievable via open systems
and effective and secure authentication and authorization
procedures.
-  To be Interoperable, data should “use and speak the same
language” via use of standardized vocabularies.
- To be Reusable, data must be adequately described to a new user,
have clear information about data-usage licenses, and have a
traceable “owner’s manual,” or provenance.
