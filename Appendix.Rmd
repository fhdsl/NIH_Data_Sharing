# Additional resources {-}

Librarians and other stakeholders have joined minds to produce guidance materials for researchers, libraries, and librarians to prepare for the 2023 NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy. The working group at the Arnold Library has created documents for librarians and researchers to use in their institutions as they work to comply with the new policy, including: 

Glossaries of DMSP & NIH Grant Terminology 

Checklist for Researchers 

Policy Readiness Checklist for Librarians 

Example DMSP & Example DMSP catalog 

You can download the materials and see any updated releases at our [OSF project page](https://osf.io/uadxr/) . They have also utilized the OSF wiki to provide descriptions of our outputs, as well as citation information. 

We hope that you will spread the word and use these resources at your institution and in your libguides. Please feel free to remix these documents to suit your needs with credit to the library working group. Please contact Beth Levine with any questions.
